@implementation AppUser


// What is this class, you ask?

// This is a shell implementation of the BRAppUser class, the class that is used as a singleton to model the data of the current user of the app.
// The BRAppUser singleton is used throughout the Blue Rocket Fuel starter app for managing login and profile data.

// An instance of this class will be instantiated for the user model on app startup if this class is included with the app, allowing you to
// extend and provide custom functionality and data here for your own app user as needed.
